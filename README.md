# powershell-disk-spoofer
This is a free and open source powershell script designed for those who are disk serial banned on most games
It uses pnputil.exe to remove the device but still function properly, essentially a null spoof on the disk, but
doesn't use a temp driver so it has no chance of being detected. 

# Instructions
- Install either windows 10/11 (any version) 
- Download the script from the github page
- Right click the PurpleSkullDiskSpoof.ps1
- Select the "Run with Powershell" option
- Wait for it to spoof disk

# Unsupported Games
- Fortnite (Tournaments only)
- Valorant (All modes)
